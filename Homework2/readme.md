# Establishing Secure Communications for Fun Homework #2

###This homework has two goals:
1. To demonstrate that how you can make your private communication secure just by
implementing a simple encryption algorithm?
2. To introduce you the basics of breaking a larger string into blocks and converting these
blocks in form of bit vectors. This is required to perform various bitwise operations over
these strings. You will see, that the encryption/decryptions algorithms make use of such
bitwise operations heavily.
You are supposed to perform the following tasks:
1. The python script provided along with this homework implements an encryption algorithm,
that takes a plaintext message file as input and produces an encrypted file as the output.
Explain the encryption algorithm implemented by this python script. Also try to understand
how the bit operations have been performed. This will help to do future homework and
assignments.
2. Write the corresponding decryption script which will take output generated by the
encryption script and generate the same plaintext as the output that was given to the
encryption script as the input, considering both the encryption and decryption scripts are
run with the same key.
